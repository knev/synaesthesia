SYNAESTHESIA v1.1

Introduction
============

This is a program for representing sounds visually (from a CD or line
input). It goes beyond the usual oscilliscope style program by combining
an FFT and stereo positioning information to give a two dimensional
display. Some of the shapes I have observed are:
  * Drums: clouds of color, fairly high
  * Clean guitar: several horizontal lines, low down
  * Rough guitar: a cloud, low down
  * Trumpet: Lots of horizontal lines everywhere
  * Flute: A single horizontal line, low down
  * Voice: A vertical line with some internal structure

Surround sound decoding has been added in version 1.1. Ambient noise is
shown in orange.

Usage
=====

Run Synaesthesia with no parameters for information on how to use it.



This program is free. If you like it, or have any suggestions, please
send me (Paul Harrison) an email (phar6@student.monash.edu.au).
