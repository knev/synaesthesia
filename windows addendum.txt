Addendum to readme file for Windows95 version:

Make sure the mixer settings are correct for CD-Rom recording and/or Line
in. Do this by opening the mixer (loudspeaker icon at the bottom of your
Windows Taskbar). Choose "Options", "Properties", choose "Recording",
click "OK", make sure the "select" radio button is ticked for CD-Rom
and/or Line-in, depending on your preferences, and set the appropriate
volumes if necessary.

Synaesthesia might not want to start (throw an error message on the
screen) if an other CD-player program is running. Close all other
CD-players before starting synaesthesia.

Toggle between full-screen and windowed by pressing Enter.

If you have more than one soundcard, edit the synaesthesia .cfg file
(auto-generated the first time you run the program), and set the
appropriate number for your soundcard in the "wave" parameter. 0 is the
first soundcard in your system. (UNTESTED)

If you have more than one CD-Rom player, edit the synaesthesia .cfg
file (auto-generated the first time you run the program), and set the
appropriate number for your CD-Rom in the "cdrom" parameter. 0 is the
first CD-Rom in your system. (UNTESTED)

If the volume-changing doesn't work on your machine, (possible with
multiple soundcards), try changing the mixer number in the configuration
file.

If you want to rebuild the synaesthesia for Windows project, you'll
need the PTC 0.73a library. Go to www.gaffer.com, and look for PTC 0.72,
and also download the 0.73a patch.  You'll have to rebuild the library
yourself. Copy the hacked version of iwin32.cpp supplied in this zip
file over the source/iwin32.cpp file.
