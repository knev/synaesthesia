SYNAESTHESIA for Windows
Version 1.2

This is the second public release of the Windows version of Synaesthesia,
originally written by Paul Harrison, ported from Linux to Windows by
Nils Desle. This version is mostly a bug fix release.

The operation of this program should be fairly self explanatory. You
play music, it shows pretty pictures. You don't play music, it doesn't
show pretty pictures. One minor point: To switch to full screen mode,
press the "Enter" key.

For further notes, see the file "Windows addendum.txt".

Send comments or queries to me (pfh@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au) or Nils
(nils.desle@cegeka.be)

Due to circumstances beyond my control I haven't been able to merge
this version with the Linux version yet. Expect a combined Linux,
Windows and FreeBSD version, er, eventually. Before Halley's comet next
arrives, say.

Below is the original Linux README.

Introduction
============

This is a program for representing sounds visually (from a CD or line
input). It goes beyond the usual oscilliscope style program by combining
an FFT and stereo positioning information to give a two dimensional
display. Some of the shapes I have observed are:
  * Drums: clouds of color, fairly high
  * Clean guitar: several horizontal lines, low down
  * Rough guitar: a cloud, low down
  * Trumpet: Lots of horizontal lines everywhere
  * Flute: A single horizontal line, low down
  * Voice: A vertical line with some internal structure

Surround sound decoding has been added in version 1.1. Ambient noise is
shown in orange.

X-Windows support has been added in version 1.3, as well as a major redesign
of the interface. The intention is to make Synaesthesia a fully functional
CD player, suitable for use while working.

Version 1.4 adds support for play lists and viewing recorded samples.
Support for the Simple DirectMedia Layer library has also been added
(http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL) in preperation for a Windoze port
and partly just because its a great graphics library.

Usage
=====

Synaesthesia should compile on Linux systems.  Compile 
Synaesthesia by typing "make" then following the instructions displayed.

You will need to run Synaesthesia as root if you compiled it with
svgalib. Other varieties can be run by any user providing you provide 
permissions on /dev/dsp, /dev/cdrom, and /dev/mixer.

Synaesthesia creates a configuration file you can edit, named
~/.synaesthesia.  You can edit this to set the default brightness,
volume and X-Window position and size.

Run Synaesthesia with no parameters for further information on how to 
use it.
